## Solitaire README

This is a version of solitaire I hacked up using HTML, CSS, javascript with [jQuery](http://jquery.com), the [Noisy](https://github.com/DanielRapp/Noisy) plugin (for game mat texture) and only one small image. It's pretty nasty, but I wanted to get a feel for the draggable jquery-UI functionality.
